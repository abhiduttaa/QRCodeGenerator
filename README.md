### Optional Tips:
- Add a GIF or image preview of the app working. It instantly grabs attention.
- If you used any library (like `qrcodejs`), mention it in the `Built With` section.
- You can use shields (badges) like:  
  `![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/your-username/qr-code-generator)`  
  to show project activity.

Let me know if you'd like a badge version, dark mode preview, or a markdown with Hindi translation too!
